This is a personal project I challenged myself to work on for a week, based on the App Store game Flow Free. I originally planned to randomly generate the levels but I didnt have the time to work out a method so instead I inserted a level for each level size going from 5x5 to 10x10, which can be changed in the main file.

The goal of this puzzle game is to fill out the grid while connecting each of the dots to the dots with the same colour by clicking and dragging from one of them to the other.

To run this you will need the following Python modules:
- numpy
- pygame
- random
- os

If I were to come back and make a better version of this some of what I would add would be:
- Random level generation
- Main menu
- GUI feedback that the puzzle is complete rather than the console just printing "Done"
