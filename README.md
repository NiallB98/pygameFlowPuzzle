This is a personal project I'm doing in my free time in the hopes of eventually making a finished version of the mobile game Flow Free
on pc for me and my friends to play, so far I have the main mechanics of the game sorted but will still need to improve on them because
for example when dragging the mouse and moving it fast the lines will not be able to catch up to the mouse because the current mouse
collision checks when dragging over an empty space are only done for the squares next to the selected line's end point so I need to work
on a pathfinding algorithm to fix that.

I also hope to randomly generate the levels eventually, which will create pre-solved puzzles then take out the source points from them
and give that to the game, level generation may need to wait till I have more free time though as there are plenty of checks the generator
will need to go through and I'll have to plan them out before applying them to code.
